# Return-Challan
intership project -3
Welcome to the Returnable Challan repository developed during my internship at Motilal Dulichand. This project represents a significant effort to automate and streamline the handling of returnable goods through a user-friendly interface built with Visual Basic (VB) and supported by SQL databases. Our system aims to simplify the creation, tracking, and management of returnable challans, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in logistics operations.

During my internship at Motilal Dulichand, I had the opportunity to apply VB for frontend development and SQL for backend database management. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills in software development but also provided practical insights into the complexities of inventory management and logistics tracking within a real-world business environment. This project is a testament to the collaborative efforts and learning experiences gained during my time at Motilal Dulichand.
